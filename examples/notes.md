1. The speaker claims to have created an entire application from scratch in under 20 minutes using artificial intelligence.
2. The speaker used chat GPT for the code, front-end and back-end, and Stable Diffusion for all image generation.
3. The process was demonstrated with the speaker pretending to know very little about coding.
4. The resulting project included smart contracts, a website, and artwork for an NFT project.
5. The speaker plans to document the process so others can learn to use AI technology to create their own apps.
6. This can be valuable for both non-coders and developers looking to increase their effectiveness and productivity.
7. The process involves a series of steps such as choosing the blockchain platform, designing smart contracts, developing the front end, and testing and deploying the application.
8. The speaker used Ethereum as the blockchain platform.
9. The necessary tools for the process include a text editor, node.js, ganache, truffle, and Metamask.
10. The process involves designing and deploying smart contracts, developing the front end, and connecting them.
11. Specific steps include creating a new truffle app and compiling and deploying smart contracts.
12. The speaker is a blockchain developer who has been using AI tools to increase productivity.
13. The speaker encourages viewers interested in becoming blockchain masters to visit dappeniversity.com/bootcamp.

- The speaker is demonstrating how to create a new truffle project using terminal commands.
- They create a new directory using the "make directory" command and then enter it before running the "truffle init" command.
- The speaker opens the newly created project in Sublime Text.
- The speaker mentions the importance of creating smart contracts and that they are stored in the contracts directory.
- The speaker provides an example scenario for a smart contract - creating an NFT collection with 10 NFTs where users must pay 0.01 ether to mint each one.
- The speaker shares the full code for the NFT smart contract and instructs to install Open Zeppelin contracts and update the truffle configuration file.
- The speaker opens a new file in Sublime Text and pastes the NFT contract code.
- They install Open Zeppelin contracts using "npm install" command and update the truffle configuration file with the provided code.

---

- The code sets up the network and adds the correct solidity version
- The truffle.config file is cleared out and updated with the correct solidity version
- The solidity version inside the main contract is also updated
- The contract is compiled and an error is encountered which is expected when coding with an AI
- The error message is copied and pasted into chat GPT which assists in fixing the error
- A new script is created under the migrations directory to deploy the smart contract
- The migration script is run using the truffle migrate command but an error is encountered
- Chat GPT assists in identifying the error and suggests starting Ganache which resolves the issue
- The next step is to develop the front end and React.js is chosen as the option
- The command 'npx create react app nft mentor' is copied and pasted into the terminal to create the React app
- The 'npm install' command is run to install web 3 react bootstrap.

---

- The video is the host creating an application that connects to the blockchain using React and Truffle.
- The host creates a new file called web3.js in the source directory and copies some code into it to connect the application to the blockchain.
- They create a new file called my nft contract.json in the source directory and copy the Json representation of the smart contracts ABI into it.
- The host imports the web3.js library and the nft contract ABI into the app.js file and replaces the current code with it.
- The video shows how to deploy the app to a hosting provider or serve it locally using a development server.
- The host asks Chat GPT for help in updating the React app to allow users to purchase the nfts with the click of a button and display the nfts on the page.
- The video ends with the host asking Chat GPT for help in adding pictures for the nfts.

- AI image generator used to create NFT images
- Chad GPT provides options to add images to the NFT app: upload to IPFS or import locally
- The images were imported locally into the project and added to an images directory
- Navbar with brand name and user address added to the project with the help of Chad GPT
- Code for `my NFT Marketplace` and `connected account` deleted to clean up the code
- HTML code blocks were rearranged and moved around to make the project look better
- NFT was bought using metamask and the transaction was signed
- The demonstration shows how to create a full stack blockchain application from scratch with the help of artificial intelligence
- It is emphasized that the technology can be used to quickly get something off the ground but it doesn't replace the need for coders

---

- The speaker doesn't think technology will completely replace coders because they had to ask it to change some things despite being able to accomplish a lot.
- The speaker believes that technology will increase the effectiveness of coders and help them get things done faster.
- It can also be helpful for people trying to become a blockchain developer as they can learn twice as fast with the technology.
- The speaker encourages viewers to like and subscribe to the YouTube channel.
- The speaker recommends visiting their YouTube homepage for free courses and taking a master's shortcut to become an in-demand blockchain master through their bootcamp on adaptiveversion.com.
- The bootcamp can help people with zero coding experience become real-world launching developers in a few months.
- The speaker thanks the viewers for watching and says goodbye until next time.

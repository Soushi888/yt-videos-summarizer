- The video creator claims to have used artificial intelligence to create an entire application in under 20 minutes, including front-end, back-end, and artwork using Chat GPT and Stable Diffusion.
- They claim to have done this without any prior coding knowledge, using AI prompts and minor code modifications.
- The purpose of the video is to show viewers how they can use this technology to create their own apps, or how developers can leverage it to increase their effectiveness.
- They recommend viewers subscribe to their channel for more blockchain-related content, and suggest joining their bootcamp at dappeniversity.com to become a "blockchain master".
- The video shows the creator using Chat GPT to prompt for instructions on how to create a full-stack blockchain app using Ethereum.
- The creator follows the instructions to install text editors, node.js, Ganache, Truffle, and Metamask.
- Chat GPT provides instructions on designing smart contracts, developing the front-end, and connecting the front-end to the smart contracts for testing and deployment.
- The creator asks Chat GPT for more specific instructions on creating a new Truffle app, leading them to their next steps.

- The speaker explains how to create a new Truffle project by using a terminal command.
- They mention that they are using Sublime Text as a text editor.
- The speaker shows the directory structure of the Truffle project and explains that the contracts directory is where to put the smart contracts.
- The speaker moves on to the next step of designing a smart contract and asks Chat GPT to create a mental NFT collection of 10 NFTs.
- The speaker is provided with a full smart contract code for the requested NFT collection.
- The speaker is instructed to install and import the OpenZeppelin contracts, and update the truffle-config.js file accordingly.
- They explain how to add the NFT smart contract file to the Truffle project by creating a new file in the contracts directory and copying the code provided.
- The speaker follows the instructions and runs `npm install` and updates the truffle-config.js file.

- The video is explaining setup for a network and adding the correct solidity version.
- The treble Dash config file is cleared and updated with new code.
- Compiling the contracts is done and an error message is shown.
- The error message is pasted into Chat GPT to get help in fixing the error.
- The error is fixed by updating the solidity version and re-running shuffle compile.
- The next step is deploying the smart contract.
- A new script is created under the migrations directory called "to deploy contracts" and code is pasted into it.
- The migration script is run using the triple migrate command but an error occurs.
- The error message is pasted into Chat GPT to get help in fixing it.
- The suggested solution is to ensure that ethereum development client, ganache is running and listening on a specific port.
- Ganache is started and the migration script is run again successfully.
- The next step is to develop the front end using React.js.
- Chat GPT provides exact steps to create a React.js application for minting NFTs.
- The command "MPX create react app nft mentor" is used in the terminal to create a React.js application.
- The npm install command is used to install web 3, react, and bootstrap.

- The video is demonstrating how to connect a front-end application to a smart contract using web3.js and React.
- The instructor creates a file called web3.js inside the source directory of the React app and copies some code to it to connect the app to the blockchain.
- A new file called my nft contract.json is created in the source directory and the ABI representation of the smart contract is copied to it.
- The instructor imports the web3.js library and the nft contract ABI to the app.js file and replaces some code as instructed.
- The app is then deployed to a hosting provider or served locally using a development server.
- The instructor suggests making changes to the app to provide users with the ability to purchase NFTs and to show them on the page.
- The instructor asks Chat GPT how to add pictures for the NFTs and finds the answer using AI.

---

- The speaker is using an AI image generator to create NFT images for their project.
- They picked the best 10 images out of the 12 generated.
- Chad GPT was consulted for help to put the images into the NFT app.
- There are two options for adding images: upload to IPFS or import locally.
- The speaker chose to import locally for the sake of time.
- The speaker created a navbar with their brand name and the user's address.
- Code was deleted to clean up the page.
- HTML code was rearranged to improve the page layout.
- The speaker tested the app by buying an NFT using Metamask and signing a transaction.
- The speaker demonstrated the ability to use AI technology to create a full-stack blockchain application.
- The speaker emphasized the efficiency of using technology but stated that coding skills are still necessary.

- The technology shown in the video is not going to replace coders completely.
- The speaker admits to asking a knowledgeable coder for help, even though the technology helped them accomplish quite a bit.
- The technology will increase the effectiveness of coders and help them get things done faster.
- The speaker is happy to help their students leverage the power of chat GPT to learn blockchain faster.
- The speaker encourages viewers to like and subscribe to their channel, and to check out their free blockchain courses.
- The speaker also mentions their paid bootcamp on adaptiveversion.com to help individuals become in-demand blockchain developers, increase their salary, and break into the booming blockchain industry.
- Zero coding experience is required to get started with the bootcamp.
